# Python-Projects
*******************************************
### HELLO :3 ###

So what is this thing anyway??

Well, this is my little collection of python projects, mostly for my current CS class (seperate to CS50) the first few will be very simple but I hope te imp[rove in time.
If the program requires anything other than what is contained in the repo folder it will be listed in that folder's readme.
All projects are completely free to use as the liscence says :3
In time, when I feel like a reasonable ammount of content is released I might set up a kofi for possible tipping but everything here will always remain free and open source.

For now it there will mostly be games and I will keep an updated list here

> Fruit: A very simple fruit ninja style game run with pygame
